At this moment, it can be attached to:

- shapesafe
- spookystuff

The scopes of this projects are:

- providing abstractions for lazy, inductive graph, poset, semilattice, tree
  - and their visualisation utilities
- providing tools for type & logic traversing tools, including subtype semilattice, type constructor graph, implicit search & deduction tree
